<!-- /code_chunk_output -->

## Tasks
  * Task 1: Small Data Supervised Learning
    * Train classifier using a limited version of Fashion MNIST dataset 
    * Apply transfer learning
  * Task 2: One-shot / Few-shot Learning
    * Design model to recognize a number of novel classes with insufficient number of training images
